## Answer

- **Savings Plans 1.00 / 1**

The correct response option is Savings Plans. Amazon EC2 Savings Plans enable you to reduce your compute costs by committing to a consistent amount of compute usage for a 1-year or 3-year term. This results in savings of up to 72% over On-Demand Instance costs. Any usage up to the commitment is charged at the discounted Savings Plan rate (for example, $10 an hour). Any usage beyond the commitment is charged at regular On-Demand Instance rates. The other response options are incorrect because: Reserved Instances are a billing discount that is applied to the use of On-Demand Instances in your account. You can purchase Standard Reserved and Convertible Reserved Instances for a one-year or three-year term, and Scheduled Reserved Instances for a one-year term. Unlike Savings Plans, Reserved Instances do not require you to commit to a consistent amount of compute usage over the duration of the contract. Spot Instances are ideal for workloads with flexible start and end times or that can withstand interruptions. Spot Instances leverage unused EC2 computing capacity and offer you cost savings at up to 90% of On-Demand Instance prices. Dedicated Hosts are physical servers with EC2 instance capacity that is fully dedicated to your use. You can use your existing per-socket, per-core, or per-VM software licenses to help maintain license compliance. You can purchase On-Demand Dedicated Hosts or Reserved Dedicated Hosts. Of all the Amazon EC2 options that were covered in this course, Dedicated Hosts are the most expensive.

- **AWS Organizations 1.00 / 1**
